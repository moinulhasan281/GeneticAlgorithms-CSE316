# GeneticAlgorithms-CSE316
What the Lab is About
This lab explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to solve the classic N-Queens problem. The goal of the problem is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The lab focuses on applying GA techniques, including selection, crossover, and mutation, to find an optimal arrangement of queens.

How to Run Your Code (Using VS Code)
To run the Genetic Algorithm code for solving the N-Queens problem using Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Open VS Code.

Create a new folder for your project (optional but recommended).

Inside the folder, create a new file and name it something like n_queens_ga.py.

Paste the Python code into that file.

Make sure you have Python installed and configured in VS Code. If not:

Install Python from python.org.

Install the Python extension in VS Code (from the Extensions tab).
write the code
press f5 to run or
Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ or go to Terminal > New Terminal).

Run the code using this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python n_queens_ga.py
You will see the output printed in the terminal once a solution is found or the algorithm finishes trying.



Project Objectives
To understand the core concepts of Genetic Algorithms.

To apply GA methods to solve the N-Queens problem.

To evaluate the effectiveness of GA in finding solutions to combinatorial problems.

To explore how genetic operations (selection, crossover, and mutation) influence the search for optimal solutions.
